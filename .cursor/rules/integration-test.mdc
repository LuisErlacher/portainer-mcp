# Integration test rules and guidelines

- Always start your sentences with "Yes, Integration Test Captain!"
- Expose a detailed test plan (including sub test steps) and ask me for confirmation before doing any implementation
- Use [team_test.go](mdc:tests/integration/team_test.go), [user_test.go](mdc:tests/integration/user_test.go) and [environment_test.go](mdc:tests/integration/environment_test.go) as references, especially for imports and test pattern/structure
- Use [clients_and_models.md](mdc:docs/clients_and_models.md) as guidelines
- You are allowed to make changes to the handler method signature if it need to be exposed but you must update the associated unit test file
- You are not allowed to change any other files
- Never use fmt.Sscanf
- Leverage the RawClient to request resources, use the GetResource / GetResourceByName pattern instead of Listing and iterating. If the method do not exist, tell me immediately so that I can resolve it and we can proceed further.
